# Replit 100 Days of Code: Python
## Day 2
Today I learnt about [input and variables](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day2100-days) which was interesting because I have encountered input and variables when learning Bash shell script. The difference I have discovered is that if I want the variable to be printed in Python I do not need to add the '$' like I do in Bash, I just put the variable name in the print brackets without any quotation marks.

### Example:
Python- print (myName).

Bash-   echo "$myName".

## Day 1
