# Replit 100 Days of Code: Python


## Day- 12 Debugging
Debugged this [code](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-12100-days#main.py) for today's challenge.

## Day- 11 Seconds in a year
Today's challenge was writing a script that calculates [how many seconds there are in a year or leap year](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-11100-days#main.py).

## Day- 10 A bit of Math 😰
Haha, today I did a bit of math and made a [tip calculator](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-10100-days). I got a bit confused with this part of the script, ``` (1 + tip / 100), ``` and spent an embarrassing amount of time asking Chatgpt some questions. It's safe to say I understand it now: the ```1``` represents the original amount (100%), and the ```tip/100``` represents the additional percentage being added. I guess it is time I brush up on my maths skills 🫣.

## Day- 9 Casting
I learned about casting today, which involves converting one type of data to another and facilitating operations requiring consistent data formats. I created this [Generation Indentier](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-9-100-days) which was fun.


## Day- 8 Wholesome Affirmation Generator Project
I didn't expect this [Wholesome Affirmation Generator](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-8-100-days) to take me almost an hour, but I got sucked into the process, and the time flew by. I also learnt two things that we haven't covered yet on the course, through browsing Replit forum:
+ First, making my code simpler with case-sensitive input, so instead of writing this:
  ```python
  if day == "Monday" or day == "monday"
  ```
   I wrote the input statement in such a way that even if the input was written with capital letters, it would convert all characters in the string to lowercase. This is how I wrote the statement:
  ```python
  day = input ("What day is it?").lower()
  ```
 + Secondly, using the ```in ``` operator to check if the value of the variable ```feeling``` matches either "good", "great", "awesome" or "fantastic", controlling the execution flow based on this condition.
    ```python
    if feeling in ("good", "great", "awesome", "fantastic"):
    ```
    Instead of writing it like this:
   ```python
   if feeling == "good" or  feeling == "great" or feeling == "awesome" or feeling == "fantastic":
   ```

## Day- 7 Nesting
I used my nesting skills to build a game to test if you're a true [TV Show fan](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-7100-days). I also snuck in some input and variables for fun!

## Day 6- Elif
What the elif did I build today? A hack-proof [login system](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day6100-days)!


## Day 5- If/Else
  I used if and else statements to write the script of this [Demon Slayer Character Creator](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day5100-days). I've  built my very own Akinator😎.

## Day 4- Custom storybook project
  Today I made this [custom storybook](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day4100-days) and added colour to some of the words, which was cool.
  
  > FUN FACT:
  >I must confess I was today years old when I discovered this is the same way custom books people buy online are generated 🤯.

## Day 3- Concatenate
Concatenating is like glueing a string (text) and variable together into a single sentence. Today I learned to do that by using ',' on my print statement to combine the string and variables into one sentence. Here is a [whacky recipe maker](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-3100-days#main.py) I made that demonstrates the powers of concatenation.


## Day 2- Input and Variables
Today I learnt about [input and variables](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day2100-days) which was interesting because I have encountered input and variables when learning Bash shell script. The difference I have discovered is that if I want the variable to be printed in Python I do not need to add the '$' like I do in Bash, I just put the variable name in the print brackets without any quotation marks.

### Example:
Python- print (myName).

Bash-   echo "$myName".

## Day 1- Committing to the Challenge
