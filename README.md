# Replit 100 Days of Code: Python


## Day 6- Elif
What the elif did I build today? A hack proof [login system](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day6100-days)!


## Day 5- If/Else
  Used if and else statements to write the script of this [Demon Slayer Character Creator](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day5100-days). I've  built my very own Akinator😎.

## Day 4- Custom storybook project
  Today I made this [custom storybook](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day4100-days) and added colour to some of the words, which was cool.
  
  > FUN FACT:
  >I must confess I was today years old when I discovered this is the same way custom books people buy online are generated 🤯.




## Day 3- Concatenate
Concatenating is like glueing a string (text) and variable together into a single sentence. Today I learned to do that by using ',' on my print statement to combine the string and variables into one sentence. Here is a [whacky recipe maker](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-3100-days#main.py) I made that demonstrates the powers of concatenation.


## Day 2- Input and Variables
Today I learnt about [input and variables](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day2100-days) which was interesting because I have encountered input and variables when learning Bash shell script. The difference I have discovered is that if I want the variable to be printed in Python I do not need to add the '$' like I do in Bash, I just put the variable name in the print brackets without any quotation marks.

### Example:
Python- print (myName).

Bash-   echo "$myName".

## Day 1- Committing to the Challenge
