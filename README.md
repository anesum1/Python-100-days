# Replit 100 Days of Code: Python


## Day 4- Custom storybook project
Today I made this [custom storybook](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day4100-days) and added colour <span style="color:blue">c</span><span style="color:red">o</span><span style="color:green">l</span><span style="color:orange">o</span><span style="color:purple">u</span><span style="color:yellow">r</span> to some of the words, which was cool.
I must confess I was today years old when I discovered this is the same way custom books people buy online are generated ü§Ø.

## Day 3- Concatenate
Concatenating is like glueing a string (text) and variable together into a single sentence. Today I learned to do that by using ',' on my print statement to combine the string and variables into one sentence. Here is a [whacky recipe maker](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day-3100-days#main.py) I made that demonstrates the powers of concatenation.


## Day 2- Input and Variables
Today I learnt about [input and variables](https://replit.com/@AnesuMasawi/day2100-days) which was interesting because I have encountered input and variables when learning Bash shell script. The difference I have discovered is that if I want the variable to be printed in Python I do not need to add the '$' like I do in Bash, I just put the variable name in the print brackets without any quotation marks.

### Example:
Python- print (myName).

Bash-   echo "$myName".
